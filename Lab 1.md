**Lab 1**

Lab 1 in the CMTH 642 course at Ryerson University was designed to teach aspiring data scientists various intermediate level aspects of data science; most notably how to train your data set.



No this is not the same as training your pet dog LOL!!



Training your data means to split the data set into two parts; train and test randomly. The randomization is integral to this aspect because you do not want to split the data by simply taking a set portion of the data. Randomizing the selection allows the data to split a specified percentage throughout the entire data set. 

For instance, let's say you want to train your data off a 70/30 split; 70 being a train portion and 30 being test. Without randomizing the machine will take the top 70% of the data as the train portion and bottom 30% as the test portion whereas by randomizing it will take 70% from the entire data set and then the other 30% is allocated to test.



To begin I would recommend reading the non solutions .rmd file. It explains each question and why it is done.
